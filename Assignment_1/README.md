1. avg_price.txt, price_list.csv, price_list.txt, prices.png
2. Two text files, a picture and a csv document which stands for comma sepperated values which is rather self explanatory.
3. The program prints the avg price: 3307228.119047619
4. "def download_txt", creates a download folder at a given path, and places the downloaded content from the other methods into said path.
"def generate csv", presumably generates the csv files by defineing the rows and collumns desired in the document.
"def read_prices", takes the csv and converts the data from the csv document into a list of prices to a txt document.
"def compute_avg_price", generates the avg price from a data set which presumably comes from the github repo, and saves it as a txt file.
"def generate_plot", generates a png file using the data presumably from the github repo and saves it in the given dir.
"def run()", runs all of the above methods.
