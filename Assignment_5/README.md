# Assignment 5

This transformation reads two csv files, cleans them for odd characters and then merge them into one.
This particular transformation is very specific, seeing as there was a obvious problem in one of the csv files with the danish chars "æ, ø, å".
In this case, the general transformation isn't very applicable, to many other scenarios, but the principal is.
Reading and manipulating general problems in csv documents could be automated and a fairly useful process, to make sure the documents you work with are uniform.
